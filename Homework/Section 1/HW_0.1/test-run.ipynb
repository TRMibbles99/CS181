    "\n",
    "1. If the question requires you to answer in English, there will be a following markdown cell, where you can enter (and format) your answer.  These answers will always be manually graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the question requires you to write Python code, there will be a following code cell.  Within the code cell, you will give your Python answer.  Sometimes this code cell will give you some preliminary code and/or some code that somehow uses or incorporates your answer and helps you see what is expected.  Whether these is initial or following code, the cell will have the two line sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # YOUR CODE HERE\n",
    "    raise NotImplementedError()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will **delete both of these lines** and replace them with your solution to the problem.  If you do not delete the second line, then even if you have correct code, execution of the cell will result in an error and the question will be assessed as incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of Python coding questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. We ask you to use `print` to demonstrate your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. We ask you to write code and assign one or more answers to one or more Python variables, which we explicitly name.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. We ask you to write a Python function that performs some specified computation, uses parameters as specified, and *returns* some result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For code-type questions, there will often be an additional following code cell.  The purpose of this code in some way \"checks\" your code.  The purpose is (mostly) twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To give you some (preliminary) feedback on your answer.\n",
    "2. To permit some automation of checking your homework submissions by the course staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the checking cell works is to, in some way, evaluate your code and compare the answer that you produce to the answer that is expected.  If your answer matches the expected answer, the cell should appear to simply execute (with no output).  But if your answer does not match the expected answer, a Python `exception` is raised, displaying some type of error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this mechanism for good and productive feedback, you should look carefully at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the error message, which will give specifics on the mismatch,\n",
    "- the **point** at which the checking cell resulted in an error.  You may find that your code is partially right, and \"passed\" some of the tests, but not others.\n",
    "- **what your code produced** and **what the expected result was**.  You can (and should) use good debugging techniques to figure out how and why the deviation occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should note that sometimes giving checking code that is visible to the student can \"give away\" the answer.  So the system we use allows for \"hidden tests\" that are not visible in your Notebook, but get added and checked when we use the automated system for assessing your assignment.\n",
